# AI-Based_Drug_Interaction_Detection_System

Step 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing
Data Acquisition:

Gather a diverse dataset of medication labels and patient records containing drug interaction information.

Ensure compliance with privacy laws (e.g., HIPAA, POPIA) when handling patient records.

Retrieve authoritative interaction datasets from FDA, WHO, or local healthcare regulatory bodies.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Implementation:

Use tools like Tesseract OCR or Google Vision API to extract text from medication labels.

Fine-tune OCR models to improve accuracy in recognizing varying font styles and label formats.

Validate extracted text using spell-checking and dictionary matching.

Image Preprocessing for Model Robustness:

Use FastAI's image augmentation techniques to improve generalization (rotation, contrast adjustments, resizing).

Normalize images and convert them into grayscale or adaptive contrast formats.

Apply segmentation if needed to isolate relevant label text areas.

Step 2: Model Selection & Training
Vision Model for Image Classification:

Use ResNet34 or ResNet50 for medication label classification.

Train on labeled datasets to recognize brand names, generic names, and dosages.

Implement transfer learning if dataset size is limited.

Text-Based Drug Name Extraction & Interaction Analysis:

Use FastAI's text processing module to refine extracted text.

Develop a Named Entity Recognition (NER) pipeline for identifying drug names.

Implement a pre-trained biomedical NLP model (e.g., BioBERT) for drug name matching.

Model Fine-Tuning & Validation:

Train text models to predict potential drug interactions based on reference datasets.

Validate results against manually curated datasets.

Use cross-validation techniques to optimize performance.

Step 3: Drug Interaction Detection
Cross-Referencing Extracted Drug Names:

Match recognized drug names against interaction databases (FDA, WHO).

Build an API-based lookup system for real-time database queries.

Machine Learning-Based Alert System:

Implement a classification model that flags potentially harmful interactions.

Use deep learning methods (LSTM, Transformers) for sequence-based predictions.

Develop severity-based interaction scoring (e.g., critical, moderate, low-risk).

Rare Interaction Detection Using Autoencoders:

Train autoencoder models to recognize anomaly interactions.

Fine-tune detection thresholds for rare but dangerous drug combinations.

Step 4: Deployment & Integration
Application Development:

Create a mobile or web-based app where users can scan medication labels.

Implement Flutter or React Native for front-end development.

Ensure UI accessibility, especially for visually impaired users.

Electronic Health Records (EHRs) Integration:

Develop secure API connections to hospital databases for real-time interactions.

Implement authentication and access control (OAuth2, JWT).

Regulatory Compliance & Safety Considerations:

Ensure compliance with healthcare regulations (HIPAA, SAHPRA, FDA, WHO guidelines).

Conduct extensive testing for clinical validation.

Develop fail-safe alerts and disclaimers for medical responsibility.

Next Steps
Implement prototype testing with real-world data.

Gather user feedback to improve usability.

Refine the model to increase accuracy and reduce false positives.
